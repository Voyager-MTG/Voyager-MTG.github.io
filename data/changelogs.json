Now you simply tap the enchantments in order to cast the spell at instant speed.\n**Breach of Protection** Now lists healing as a keyword. \n-# As healing is a keyword that also gains life, it made sense to allow for players to reveal creatures with the keyword in order to pathbound Breach of Protection.\n**Crowned Entity** Now {1}{G} from {G}{G}. Now also changed from a \"you may\" to a \"up to\". Exiles only one card rather than two now. Now size 5\/5 from 6\/6.\n-# Being locked to mono-green or heavy green as a grave hate card made it a difficult card to consider. Now pushed towards a more playable rate.\n**Guardian Roost** Reworked. Still a 1\/1 Flying creature, new pathbound cost: Pathbound-{I\/W}, Reveal two cards with flying and\/or vigilance from your hand. Now has vigilance. Now has \"When you cast this spell, if it isn't a copy, trace three cards named Guardian Roost into your hand.\"\n-# The original card, while extremely funny, was and is problematic in the long run. It was worth doing though.\n**Korna, Vinimroth Historian** Has been updated to no longer give infinite combats.\n-# This card used to softlock the game. Now it doesn't.\n**Mischievous Fox** Tap ability costs {T} from {2}, {T}. \n-# This is primarily a limited change.\n**Rebuke the Foul** Now costs {W}. Now exiles target creature if you've illuminated white.\n-# This change was made to give decks intending to illuminate white a bit more strength where it needs it. The card was unplayably bad, even for its limited, so the change is important.\n**Scars of Oil** Now only mills one card, and now only puts one card into your sanctum from graveyard. \n-# The card was quite strong in multiples, to the point where you could mill your deck. Now it plays a bit safer.\n**Shaman of Rites Lost** Now has \"Exile three cards from your graveyard: Put a +1\/+1 counter and a healing counter on this creature.\"\n-# The goal of this change is to allow for it to exist as a magic card after it was changed from surveil 2 to surveil 1.\n**Starbright Entity** Now a 3\/3 from 2\/3. \n-# Small change that helps reduce the number of board stalls.\n**Accord Mentor** Loses the UEOT +2\/+2 boost, now has on second spell cast \"you may activate one of this creatures activated abilities without paying its costs.\" \n-# The boost to creatures was dubious in terms of pie for blue, even more dubious in ever mattering in a game.\n**Ash to Hope** Now searches for three basics from two. \n-# This card was a dubious pick in limited unless you were running green and needed to splash. Even then, it sucked. This change allows it to matter while also being a potential card for constructed lists.\n**Avakin Riftseeker** Now a 2\/3 from 2\/2, Activated ability now costs {__I__} from {1}{__I__}. \n-# Riftseeker was incredibly close to being playable, but died too hard to removal in a way that was incredibly relevant. Now gets through for damage a lot more often, but not so much more that it's untenable.\n**Bearer of Change** Now mills each player from target player.\n-# There wasn't a reason to ever target the opponent outside of incredibly niche situations.\n**Dromencal's Respite** Now an Enchantment Artifact. No longer taps two untapped nonland permanents in order to add {C}, now instead natively taps for {C.} \n-# The chances that the card would have been silly were massive, and the fact that it was a common already made the situation more dire. \n**Multaph, Riftborn God** No longer \"Silver Washes\" for its casting cost or abilities.\n-# The ability rarely matters, and is reducing readability on the card.\n**Multaph's Resplendant** Now a 1\/4 from 2\/2, Fracture ability grants +2\/+0 as well. \n-# The card seriously underperforms in every place that it could. Now can put together some damage.\n**Ola, Kaln-Ocean Spellkeeper** Now a 2\/2 from a 1\/1.\n-# This card didn't need to be so incredibly weak in combat starting off.\n**Conflict Mentor** Now creates a token at the start of each combat \n-#  This is mainly a change for limited. As Red Black was struggling for strong non-Brood Protector token generation, conflict mentor is meant to help it through.\n**Outlands Diviner** Loses Trample, now has size 4\/4 from 3\/3.\n-#  This is mostly a change for its limited environment.\n**Outlands Pathwarden** Reworked. New pathbound condition looks for seven or more cards in your graveyard. Now is a 4\/3 from 3\/3 and has \"Ward--Discard a card\" and \"When this creature enters, return up to one target creature or artifact from your graveyard to your hand.\" \n-# This change solves a flavour issue that I had with it, a long-term power concern, as well as being a generally medium card beforehand.\n**Resolute Watcher** Now a 3\/4 from a 3\/2. Now has Ward 2. \n-# Resolute watcher looks fine but is an overall terrible card cosplaying as a draw engine.\n**Roduth's Guard** Now a 4\/2 from a 3\/2.\n-# The card was doing its job well, but struggled to end the game in a meaningful way in its limited environment. Now represents a 5 turn clock.\n**Towering Protector** Now also an enchantment. \n-# Being the one and only artifact creature to exist in the entirety of vinimroth eternities, it led a very sad life in limited by barely mattering outside of incredibly niche decks.\n**Urkial, Outlands Clanleader** Luminous ability reworked. Now has \"Creatures you control get healing 2 as long as you\u2019ve illuminated white. The same is true with vigilance and blue, menace and black, first strike and red, trample and green, haste and silver.\"\n-# Prior, this card existed in a \"funny\" but ultimately problematic combo where you make three all colors tokens on turn 3, put down Urkial, illuminate all six available colours, then swing for 21. That was verifiably silly and untenable for a healthy format in the long run.\n**Aspiring Entity** Now has the land enter untapped.\n-# Another card just on the edge of relevancy in its limited, now worth considering over entities of the same mana value.\n**Path to Ages** Now costs {1}{R}{R}{R} from {1}{R}{R}{R}{R}. No longer self exiles.\n-# The card was pushed into unplayability due to me wanting to never have printed a good ritual, let alone one that can come out of the sanctum. These changes were made due to it already being incredibly difficult to chain multiple copies together, let alone casting the first copy, as well as having an outlet for the mana.\n**Path to Restoration** No longer puts a finality counter on the permanent returned.\n-# There was no reason for it to do this, and with the mindset of making sure things sucked, I made an addition that ultimately didn't matter.\n**Verem-Volcano Warrior** Now a 5\/5 from 4\/5.\n-# Increased power to reduce board stalls and push for game.\n**Massive wording change for traces.** \"trace its skill\", \"trace a card named Voidstone Shard\", \"trace two cards named Voidstone Shards\", \"Trace a copy of target nontoken creature\", New RT: \"Create that card. Traces are cards that become copies when they enter public zones.\"\n-#  This change was done in order to standardise trace wording to be more in line with conjure, as well as to establish what tracing is. Tracing is an action. You \"trace\" a card by creating that card in the listed zone.\n**Path's Strider** Now mills a card on tap. \n-# Got a bad pathbound card on top due to your opponent playing the game? Now you don't.\n**Fadove Reinforcement** Now looks for two or more permanents with creature types rather than having you sacrifice a token.\n-# The card was ever so slightly bad in a way that mattered, now available for decks that play to the board more than just with one or two creatures in the deck.\n**Path of the Rift** No longer asks for nontoken permanents.\n-# There was no reason it had that restriction.",
