### Branching Paths

</change-preview>

This change was made because the ability to "time walk" someone for 1 mana, even if it requires 5 differently named lands is bad gameplay. If used correctly, branching paths had the ability to ["yata-lock"](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Yata-Garasu_Lockdown) (stop the opponent from drawing).

### Meirel Pathrunner

</change-preview>

Meirel Pathrunner's cost change was done in an effort to reduce or remove the upside of ["scamming"](/search?search=c%3Ab+t%3Ainstant+o%3Awhen+o%3Adies+o%3Areturn). The card was also changed to no longer have the upside of becoming a 7/7 menace as that was provably egregious.

</change-preview>

At 1 mana evoke it was provably silly. Had synergies with cards that interacted with lands in graveyards, and *at worst* was a mishra's bauble. The buff in pt was made to make the card more playable in fair decks.

### Morraire Shimmer Patrol

https://github.com/Voyager-MTG/Voyager-MTG.github.io/blob/cadb7bc054d2ad849c8c300f158d39fd5ad47037/sets/FOE-files/img/314_Morraire%20Shimmer%20Patrol.jpg?raw=true

</change-preview>

Shimmer Patrol was given a change to prevent it from being abusable with flickers as it would represent an on-board bounce for spells, however, in the process it needed to get a toughness boost so it could function in combat.

</change-preview>

Changed to not work with up the beanstalk-style effects. Flying over menace to make it less blockable with the prevalence of tokens made it difficult for it to get in.

</change-preview>

Evoke cost changed from 1 to not act as a cantrip as well as to prevent scamming. MV lowere from 5 to prevent beans silliness.

### Marie, Hungerbound

<change-preview>
https://github.com/Voyager-MTG/Voyager-MTG.github.io/blob/cadb7bc054d2ad849c8c300f158d39fd5ad47037/sets/FOE-files/img/10_Marie,%20Hungerbound.jpg?raw=true
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1341926153631563826/1408205308005974147/image.png?ex=68a8e4e4&is=68a79364&hm=56bc3a218762b09a73c1415362bcfee269f8ba6a0273f2bb5e940bcb77603249&
</change-preview>

Marie was able to start at a high loyalty and acrew too much loyalty by locking down creatures that would attack it as well as removing noncreatures. In combination with [[Far-off Door]], you could completely control combat as well as get lots of card selection and work towards killing your opponent. The rework splits up the ability to stop creatures from attacking and the card selection/damage ability so it doesn't do so much at once. (NOTE: This was a card that should've been flagged early but wasn't due to a number of factors.)

### Faloden Barrier Scout
<change-preview>
https://github.com/Voyager-MTG/Voyager-MTG.github.io/blob/cadb7bc054d2ad849c8c300f158d39fd5ad47037/sets/FOE-files/img/27_Faloden%20Barrier%20Scout.jpg?raw=true
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1393023972161093663/1407920002945781842/image.png?ex=68a883ee&is=68a7326e&hm=def55b4765342b6e1941f2c225959004ad777946808b9fc437b19f92d5334a06&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=469&height=654
</change-preview>

Faloden Barrier Scout proved to be an integral part of the format, however, with its original toughness of 3, it was found very difficult to remove; In combat as well as with toughness-based removal. This change brings it a bit more in line with how powerful its effect is, but does not bring it down to the point that [anything can kill it](/search?search=center+mass).

</change-preview>

(Cycle of 5 colored MDFCs)

The MDFCs now enter tapped unconditionally as they were a bit too splashable and also had some unfair applications.

This card was overtuned and was too strong and kept itself alive while having an extremely impactful enters.

</change-preview>

This card was a little too easy to cast for cheap. Ramping allowed you to get it out very easily. Should be harder to cast now, and be more like a virtual 7-8 mana card.

This card never directly caused problems, but came very close and served as a major power outlier. Hopefully needing a creature in order to get a 5-drop is fine.

Shifting Silverscape was always strong as an artifact land. However, it being a land that gave you discard fodder for no cost pushed it over the line. However, losing total mana should make it more fair for discard.

### The Geminiad

</change-preview>

The Geminiad got changed because it was a card that was very efficient at stopping aggressive decks by generating a chumper every turn while also getting you ahead on mana. The first line of text on the card is mostly trinket text, but can be very relevant in matchups such as [[Prithite, Grand Orator]] combo. Overall, the card was just above rate for a 3mv manarock so we decided to change it so it didn't put you ahead on mana unless you invested some mana into it.

This card just overall had way too much text before and has gotten its text shortened with not much change to its functionality (though losing vigilance is relevant).

Similar idea here, except the card itself has gained vigilance instead of changing what it grants.

Changed to well, not suck. It wasn't really doing anything at all after it's previous (deserved) nerf, and this rework should help it not be completely irrelevant in decks that might run it.

Dynotopic Stampede caused problems with cards such as [[The Ring-Yew]] and Astrus Quandry. In addition, cards like [[Virulent Hexer]] and [[Faloden Barrier Scout]] could be used in combination with it to repeatedly stone rain the opponent. Overall, the captains deemed it too powerful of a ramp, fixing, and land destruction piece for voyager.

The broken colorless ramp deck we had in voyager highlighted a lot of issues with our mana rocks that weren't seen before. Although condensed memory looks innocuous at first, a mana rock that turns into a 5/5 is no joke. It gets you to the late game, then helps win it, while also fixing colors along the way if needed. We're keeping an eye on the other 2 mana mana rocks, but since its so close to the end of the month we only wanted to change the most egregious for now.
